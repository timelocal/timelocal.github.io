  Online time local algorithms.

  <p>

Suitability for distributed applications. The simplicity of algorithms in
time local model makes them particularly well suited for distributed applica tions.
Possibility to automate algorithm design and analysis. We explore an
intriguing link between de Brujin graphs and time local algorithms. We elabo rate more in Section TODO.
Efficient implementation. Time local algorithms can be efficiently implemented. We elaborate more in Section A

  </p>
  <p>

We propose a computation model, a variant of online algorithms [BE98], called
online time local. In online time local, the set of available online algorithms
is restricted to the algorithms whose configuration depends only on the last T
requests seen, for a parameter T .
(Note: Time local algorithms are memoryless, and do not have information
about their own configuration from the previous time step.)

Encouraged by positive results for this fundamental online problem, we high light several other areas where time local algorithms may perform well.
Distributed file management. An important class of online algorithms con cerns placement and migration of a resource in computer networks. The basic
setting is called Online File Migration problem [BBM19]. The problem Sym metric Ski Rental can be viewed as a file migration problem on 2 point
metric.
More general distributed file management problems dealing with file repli cation and update are Page Replication and Page Allocation problems.
Buffer management problems. Online algorithm for buffer management are
natural candidates for time local studies. Buffer management algorithms run
on forwarding network devices and match incoming packets to outgoing links
by establishing a crossbar [SGMP99] (Virtual Input/Output Queues).
An important problem in area of buffer management is Buffer Reorder-
ing [KP10]. The proposed solutions for simple buffer management are often
memoryless [Li11].

Efficient implementation of time local algo
rithms.

 Implementing in hardware as a boolean circuit. Performance measure:
depth of the circuit.
 Implementing as finite state automatons. States correspond to all possible
visible history windows. Each state has a label with the output for the
visible history window. The transition function depends on both the new
request and the request leaving the visible history window.
 Storing keys and values of the algorithm’s function in a hash table. Upon
seeing an input window HT = hσ1 , σ2 , σ3, . . . , σT i, we compute the hash
of HT and search the bucket at the computed index for the matching key.
Using a rolling hash function [KR87, Rab81], we can efficiently compute
the hash value for the successive input window hσ2 , σ3, σ4 , . . . , σT +1 i. In
rolling hashes, to compute the hash for the next window, we use the hash
value of the previous window, the value of a dropped old input and the
value of the newest input.
